          Introduction Among the manufacturer I work the most with, we can find Stormshield, a European network security manufacturer which I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly talk a lot about.
For a recent project with a customer, we had to deploy a Stormshield Management Center, aka SMC, which is used to manage and deploy configuration on the firewalls. The product may be a little bit new on the market (only few years) and of course may lack of some capabilities compared to other big player on the market.
